# Program Description: Ball Removal without Machine Learning
# Author: Bryan Flood

# Running the Code:
# Simply change the file path to point to the location of your image
# This program outputs both the before and after of the image

### Research:
# To research this problem, I looked up the most effective methods of object removal
# in Image Processing. 

# The most popular solutions are either pattern based or use Generative Adversarial Networks.
# Photo editing software like Photoshop and GIMP provide their own solutions.
# Adobe provides Fill based object removal and Spot Healing.
# Resynthesizer is the most popular solution for GIMP.

# The use of GANs is off the table as it is machine learning.
# Pattern Based is too complex to implement for this kind of assignment as it 
# is usually used in conjunction with quilting and subsampling.

# Both the Resynthesizer thesis and the Pattern Matching provided by Adobe inspired 
# me to come up with this solution


### Coming up with the algorithm:
# The ball removal was easy. Circle Hough is the best solution for detecting balls and circles.

# To isolate the white, I first tried to use the HSV color space which is notoriously good at isolating colors.
# I found this method produced quite nosy results and focused too much on intensity of the white.
# I ended up just converting the bgr image to gray scale and thresholding to retain only the high values.

# To maximize performance, I created a smaller cropped image based on where white was located in the image.
# When cropping I provide additional padding around the masked area to account for any shadows cast
# and I kept both sides equal so that the algorithm would be just as effective no matter how the image is orientated.

# This means that Circle Hough only must be run on a small subset of the image minimizing runtime and false positives.
# From the dimensions that Circle Hough provides I can easily remove the ball from the image.

# To replace the background based on the research I had done inpainting seemed to be the obvious choice.
# I learned quickly that it was usually only effective when used remove thin lines not large holes.
# In most case producing a distinct and unnatural radial pattern.


# My solution was to mask the top half of the outline and use inpaint to blend it better into the background.
# And for the cases whereby a sample was not available or not of high enough quality 
# I made it so the code used the pure inpaint solution.

### Improvements
# There are many improvements that could be made to this algorithm. An algorithm I implemented before this
# Sampled the whole image with multiple smaller samples used to cover the hole.
# This implemented with some basic pattern matching and rough line based stitching using Sobel would produce far better results.
# I moved to a far simpler method due to the fact it was easier to predict when the algorithm would fall back to inpaint
# and because it produced better results with my main images.
# Realistically some form of machine learning should be used for a practical application for example
# A Generative Adversarial Network trained on grass etc.

# A great paper to look at is Image Texture Tools by Paul Francis Harrison
# http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/thesis 
# This is probably the best non-machine learning based solution to this problem
# Well Worth a Read


### Performance: 
# My focus with this solution was quality but it still ended up being rather performant.
# The main performance optimisation was running the circle hough on the subset of the image.
# When timed on macOS execution took only a few milliseconds.
# This code was able to run on a live video feed.

# From my testing my solution is quite resistant to false positives.
# When a sample is valid the resulting image is very high quality.



### Error Checking:
# I ensured that the code worked on all images required.
# I preform various error checking within this code:
#       -> I ensure that the image is not None
#       -> I ensure that a ball is detected
#       -> I ensure that sample falls within the bounds of the image
#       -> I ensure that the sample is of high enough quality to be used


### Algorithm:
#  1. Crop image to location of the white ball
#  2. Detect Ball within cropped image using Circle Hough and get its dimensions
#  3. Convert cropped coordinates to lie within the full image
#  4. Get a Sample area of the image to cover the hole
#  5. Convert sample to HSV to measure Standard deviation
#  6. Check if sample is valid based on Standard deviation and whether it lies within the image
#  7. If sample is valid, blend sample in with background using inpainting
#  8. If not valid, use inpainting to fill in hole
#  9. Display before and after images
